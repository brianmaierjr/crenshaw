# Learning House Wordpress Starter Theme

The core of this theme is based on [Bones theme](https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones)

## Basic Usage

#### Install Grunt or Gulp (package-gulp.json provided)

Install grunt by navigating to the theme's `library` folder and running `npm install`

#### Watch Files

To start watching files use `grunt` or `gulp` from the `library` folder. This will run browsersync and then watch. You can now open any browser and when you make changes the browser(s) will inject the proper files automatically.

#### Grid Usage

This theme uses Susy Grid. Documentation can be found [here](http://susydocs.oddbird.net/en/latest/)

## Plugins

This core wordpress install comes equipped with a couple handy plugins that we seem to use very often

#### Advanced Custom Fields Pro

There isn't much this plugin can't do including but not limited to: repeater fields, flexible content and global theme options. Documentation can be found [here](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/)

#### RICG Responsive Images

This is new to the starter theme as of August 2015. We are implementing this to take advantage of responsive images.

#### Title and Nofollow for links

This was requested by the inbound team to get the title field back on links.

#### Yoast SEO

Yoast is required on all of our sites for SEO optimization.
