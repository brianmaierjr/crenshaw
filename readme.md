# Crenshaw Theme

This repo features the entire WordPress install including core files.

The core of this theme is based on [Bones theme](https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones).

## Basic Usage

### Install Dependencies

Install by navigating to the theme's `library` folder and running `npm install` and then `bower install`

### Watch Files

To start watching files use `grunt` from the `library` folder. This will run browsersync and then watch. You can now open any browser and when you make changes the browser(s) will inject the proper files automatically.

### Grid Usage

This theme uses Susy Grid. Documentation can be found [here](http://susydocs.oddbird.net/en/latest/)

## Menus

There are two menus setup for this theme:

1. **MAIN MENU** - Main Navigation
2. **FOOTER MENU** - Footer Navigation

## Resources

### Editor config

A `.editorconfig` file is included to maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs. To find a plugin for your editor please visit [Editor Config Plugins](http://editorconfig.org/#download) and install. We are using the standard config that is recommended by wordpress.
