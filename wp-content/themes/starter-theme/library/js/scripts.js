 * Bones Scripts File
 * Author: Eddie Machado
 *
 * This file should contain any js scripts you want to add to the site.
 * Instead of calling it in the header or throwing it inside wp_head()
 * this file will be called automatically in the footer so as not to
 * slow the page load.
 *
 * There are a lot of example functions and tools in here. If you don't
 * need any of it, just remove it. They are meant to be helpers and are
 * not required. It's your world baby, you can do whatever you want.

/*
 * We're going to swap out the gravatars.
 * In the functions.php file, you can see we're not loading the gravatar
 * images on mobile to save bandwidth. Once we hit an acceptable viewport
 * then we can swap out those images since they are located in a data attribute.
*/
function loadGravatars() {
  // set the viewport using the function above
  viewport = updateViewportDimensions();
  // if the viewport is tablet or larger, we load in the gravatars

    jQuery(this).attr('src',jQuery(this).attr('data-gravatar'));
  });

} // end function

 * Put all your regular jQuery in here.

   * You can remove this if you don't need it
